# my-sudo-kudo

Originally made for a CodeWars kata. I enjoyed the idea, so I decided to turn it into a full function. Only pure Python. To use, ```import SudokuSolver``` and run the function with the exact same name. It assumes the *parameter* is a 9x9 2D list. And returns the solution as another list.
